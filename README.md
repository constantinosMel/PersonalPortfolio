# kmeletiou.me 🌐

Welcome to the source code of my personal website — [kmeletiou.me](https://kmeletiou.me/) — a minimal and focused portfolio highlighting who I am, what I build, and what I care about.

## 👋 About Me

I'm Konstantinos Meletiou, an iOS Developer and Tech Lead based in Oslo. I specialize in crafting seamless Swift experiences, building tools that empower people to learn, focus, and grow. I love creating products that feel intuitive, purposeful, and just a little bit magical — whether they're productivity tools, experiments with haptics, or ideas at the intersection of AI and design.
